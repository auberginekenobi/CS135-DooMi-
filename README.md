<a href="#"><img src="/img/logo-square.jpg" align="left" height="100px" hspace="8" vspace="8"></a>

DUiT is a productivity manager for anyone who has ever looked at their calendar, to-do list, or jumble of sticky notes and wondered at the possibility of having one thing that could do it all. The purpose of DUiT is to organize projects, tasks, events, and other commitments (termed "du's") with a flexible, transformable interface that can go from a full weekly spread to a homework checklist to a project timeline and back again with the click of a mouse. 

## Features

**DUiT is still under development;** as such, most features exist as plans.

Implemented features are indicated with checked boxes, planned features with unchecked boxes.

- [x] Create and delete du's

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The project relies on MySQL for managing its database.

### Install

After cloning the repository and setting up your preferred configuration of a LAMP stack, you can build the database with the constructor file, `duit-db/make-tables.sql`, which can be run from within MySQL as root user:

```
mysql> source path/to/make-tables.sql;
```

The constructor features sample data and will select several tables to display to the console for example purposes only. These examples can be removed by opening the file for editing and commenting out the last fifth of the file, beginning at line 167 with:

```sql
-- SAMPLE SELECTS 

SELECT 'TABLE OF DU\'S' AS '';
...
```

The backend is primarily handled by `duit-db/db-mapper.php`, which features a plethora of functions, all individually documented within the file itself. These will be consolidated into a separate documentation location in the near future. For now, `db-mappy.php` provides a sandbox space for testing the collection of functions that interact with the database.
