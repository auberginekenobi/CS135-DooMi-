DUiT is a productivity manager for anyone who has ever looked at their calendar, to-do list, or jumble of sticky notes and wondered at the possibility of having one thing that could do it all. The purpose of DUiT is to organize projects, tasks, events, and other commitments (termed "du's") with a flexible, transformable interface that can go from a full weekly spread to a homework checklist to a project timeline and back again with the click of a mouse.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The project relies on MySQL for managing its database.

### Install

Currently there is only the database constructor, `make-tables.sql`, which can be run from within MySQL as root user:

```
mysql> source path/to/make-tables.sql;
```

The constructor features sample data and will select several tables to display to the console.

## What's New

v0.0.1 (3-14-2017): Initializing GitHub repo

* Added DB constructor
* Added README, LICENSE, and images

v0.0.0 (3-8-2017): The project is underway!

* The proposed task-keeping system is named DUiT and gets a sick new logo
